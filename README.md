## 🎵 Project Title : My MUSIC PLAYER APP

      🔹 Project Overview: The Music Player App is a modern, responsive, and interactive web application designed to provide users with a seamless music playback experience. With a clean UI and dynamic playlist             management, it allows users to play, pause, skip, and select tracks directly from the music list. The app incorporates real-time UI updates like highlighting the currently playing song, displaying                 durations, and managing active states. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a smooth, lightweight, and cross-platform compatible solution for personal or professional use.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used:
      To build this project, the following front-end technologies and libraries have been used for optimal performance and responsiveness:

          1. HTML5 & CSS3 – For semantic structure and custom styling
          2. JavaScript (Vanilla) – For core functionality, event handling, and DOM manipulation
          3. Font Awesome – For adding music control icons (play, pause, forward, backward)
          4.Custom CSS & JavaScript – For tailored UI/UX interactions
          5. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – For development, debugging, and live preview

## 💻 Platform Compatibility:
